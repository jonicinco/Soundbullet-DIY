- OLED display for:
  - Viewing levels.
  - Navigating menus.
  - Selecting test signal type.

- Multipurpose rotary encoder (instead of simple pushbuttons).
- Unscrewable 3.5 mm jack to minimize damage during transport or attached to the belt. 
- Playback of test files from microSD (not just generated noise/tone).
- RGB backlighting for status feedback.
- Greater internal modularity (easy repair and modding).

- Potential for future expansion via firmware (new modes, new generators, etc.).
