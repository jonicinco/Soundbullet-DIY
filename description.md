# Soundbullet-DIY
A tool based on the Soundbullet from Sonnect but with some features custom. Because it's open source, each user can add and customize the functionalities. Mine has an encoder, a small OLED display, a microSD card reader, an oscillator (for generating the pink noise or other tones, instead of using a wav file), a level reader through the display.
